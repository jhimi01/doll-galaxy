          <p className="text-xl">Uncontrolled components are form inputs that are handled by the DOM. In other words, their values are not controlled by React, but by the browser. The value of an uncontrolled component is set by the user input directly on the DOM, and to retrieve the value, you need to query the DOM using JavaScript. Uncontrolled components are easier to set up and manage, but they can lead to unpredictable behavior because the state of the component is not managed by React.
<br /> <br />
Controlled components, on the other hand, are form inputs that are fully controlled by React. The value of a controlled component is set and managed by React, rather than the browser. When the user interacts with a controlled component, React updates the value in its own state, and this state is then used to update the component. Controlled components provide a more predictable behavior, as you have full control over the state of the component.</p>

          any : The prop can be of any data type. <br />
bool : The prop should be a Boolean. <br />
number : The prop should be a number.   <br />
string : The prop should be a string. <br />
func : The prop should be a function. <br />
array : The prop should be an array. <br />
object : The prop should be an object. <br />
<br />
 PropTypes is a built-in library in React that allows you to specify the type and shape of props that a component should receive. This helps you catch errors early by validating the props that are being passed to a component at runtime.</p>

          <p className="text-xl">In React, a custom hook is a JavaScript function that uses React hooks (such as useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.) to provide a certain behavior or functionality that can be shared across multiple components. Custom hooks allow developers to extract reusable logic from components and promote code reuse and maintainability. <br />
          Custom hooks can be created to handle various tasks, such as managing form state, implementing infinite scrolling, fetching data from an API, or handling authentication. By creating a custom hook, you can encapsulate complex logic into a reusable function and make it available to multiple components without repeating the same code over and over again.
